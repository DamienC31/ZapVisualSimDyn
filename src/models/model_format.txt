Model Format
------------

This model format is only temporary until we can get some real models
into the game.  To do this, I need to write a loader for some model file
type (looks like it will be dxf files, exported by blender), and then a 
separate tool for compacting the text files into a .stash file.
The parameter format will remain current.

The current text format is as follows.
It is in pseudo-bnf style.

<FR> <FG> <FB> //The global RGB components of the model faces
<VERTEX> //The start of the vertex section
<NUM_VERTS> //Number of vertices
<X> <Y> <Z> //X,Y,Z compoent

<FACE> //Start of the face section
<NUM_FACES> //Number of faces
<NUMBER_SIDES> <TYPE> <V1> <V2> <Vn>
    ^            ^     ^
    |            |     | 
    |            |     - The reference of this vertex.  Indexed from 0.
    |            - The type of this face (2=line,3=tri,4=quad)
    -Number of vertices in this face

<PARAMETERS> //The start of the parameters section
<NUM_PARAMETERS> //Number of parameters for this model
<NAME> <VALUE> //The name of the parameter, followed by its value


Common Parameters
-----------------

SIZE NxN
 - The size in squares of the model.  

POWER_USAGE N
 - The power consumption (in kW) of this building

CONDUCTIVE {1|0}
 - Whether this model conducts power or not

MICROSIM N
 - The microsimulator associated with this model

Note
----
No parameters are necessary for any model, though some are expected for 
correct operation of the game
