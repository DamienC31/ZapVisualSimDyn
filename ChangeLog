- Bug fix in getMinHeight/Max - ugh.  How did I ever forget that?
  My last C++ compiler must have assumed I was returning height..my God.

- Looks like all the microsim management is going to go threaded 
  tomorrow.  Had to happen, and I hope it doesn't encourage sloppy coding.
  I'm going to speed up and properly plan the current algos before
  threading them.

- Major speedup in rendering code.  Still needs a bit of debugging
- Ran the code through a profiler for the first time.  Hmm.

- Made the hill bevel smaller, more believable
- More work on the residential simulator, so they only build near roads 
  (going to make this so they only build near roads that *go* somewhere.
- Done roads

27/11/2000 - 15:03

- Added the user class, to keep track of funds etc...
- Thought about multi-threading

- Finished the routing work!! Power lines work flawlessly
- Found a bug - can't build on a 45 deg angle tile > 4 tiles up...
  gotta be a floating point problem in cell.cpp but it's not that urgent right now

25/09/2000 - 00:49

- More routing work.  The new system is now in place, and works
  Just got to do the t-intersections for the powerlines
  Quite exciting actually, because with this new system, the backbone
  for powerlines, roads, highways, train tracks - is all in place
  All we need is some models :)
- More optimisation work.
- Lighting! Finally, looks quite good too.

- Started work again.  Created the residential simulator, for housing
  management.  Needs a lot of work.
- Planned the rewrite of the routing code (power lines, roads etc) - it's
  really kludgy, needs fixing.
- Created the render class, moved all the drawing code from world.cppw


07/10/2000 - 22:10
(LordChaos)

- Fixed a bug in the toolbar

07/08/2000 - 15:50
(LordChaos)

- Finished work on the toolbar structure.  Must make it more generic


07/08/2000 - 11:45
(LordChaos)

- More toolbox work.  Implemented triangle strips (speedup) TODO
  fix color bleeding

07/06/2000 - 00:26
(LordChaos)

- Implemented the button bar
- Imported the texture class from my old globs project


07/05/2000 - 14:00
(LordChaos)

- Work on toolbox and buttons (using callbacks)
- Thought about the rewrite of the routing code to make it cleaner and more
  generic

07/04/2000 - 00:34
(LordChaos)

- Bit of microsim work
- Changed the model format, worked out the stuff for routing (i.e. lines,
  roads etc..)


07/02/2000 - 16:50
(LordChaos)

- Now each building has references passed to all it's cells
- First work on microsimulators
- Made an attempt to use current models on angled tiles, decided
  on a better implementation though.

07/02/2000 - 00:44
(LordChaos)

- Set up a function in world.cpp to actually place structures
  properly to prevent writing over of structures and so cells
  know the owner of the structure on top of them
- More work on the power interface

06/30/2000 - 14:12
(LordChaos)

- Created the most of the power line infrastructure
  and the power conductivity stuff.  Works well too.


06/27/2000 - 18:20
(LordChaos)

- Implemented the lower terrain tool
- Extended the zone tool for industrial
- First work on structures (yay! buildings!)
- Created the "face" (polygon) and structural parameter classes

06/27/2000 - 00:10
(LordChaos)

- Fixed the ray shooting algorithm to be almost perfect
- Early work on face (polygon) class to enable work on structure class
- Version 0.0.1 released

06/26/2000 - 00:42
(LordChaos)

- Plugged all the previous tech (like the ray shooting algorithms) into the
  main version from the proof of concept.
- Got basic view working (i.e. squares/line display)

06/06/2000 - 22:57
(LordChaos)

- Stopped work on speeding up the proof of concept.  Began work on the initial
  structure of the final version.
- Laid out some base classes.
