Installation
------------
Do not install the game at the current time, just run it out of the
source directory.
This will be addressed in future releases


What Works (tm)
---------------
* Terrain Modification (up/down/level)
* Zoning (residential/commercial/industrial)
* Power sub-system (power transmission along lines)
* Routing backbone (for roads, powerlines etc)
* Basic housing (need more models - make them in BLENDER and send them to me!!)
* Basic toolbox
* Basic micro-simulators


What's coming
-------------
* Many more models for buildings
* Better toolbox
* More zones (low/hi density)
* Amusement stuff (marinas, zoos, ski-resort zone)
* Statistics


Controls
--------
A toolbox is in place.  Click on the toolbox buttons to get the submenus.
Some toolbox commands are not in place yet.  Try these keys...

    u = Raise terrain (hold left mouse down and drag)
    d = Lower terrain (same as above)
    l = Level Terrain (same)
    r = Zone residential (drag box)
    c = Zone commercial (drag box)
    i = Zone industrial (drag box)
    x = Dezone (drag box)
    k = Destroy building
    p = Place power line (Click and drag)
    t = Place Road (As above)

    View Controls
    -------------
        [ = Rotate left
        ] = Rotate right
        - = zoom in
        = = zoom out
        8 (Num Pad) - Move forward
        2 (Num PaD) - Move back


Features
--------
    . Crashes on demand
    . OpenGL based graphics
    . Fully 3D (rotateable map etc)


Playing
-------
    Houses/Etc will build if they are < 2 tiles from a road and powered.
    The big blue cube in the middle of the map is a power plant.  You
    can't build those at the moment (working on it).
    Have fun...


BUGS - Priority top (high) to bottom (low)
------------------------------------------
    . Rendering bug.  If a zone tile is behind a slope in the rendering
      direction, rendering will screw up.  This was a casualty of my new
      rendering design.  Fix coming soon.
    . A Tile is not selected sometimes if it is sloped and the mouse
      pointer is aimed at the top half of it.  Algo needs work
