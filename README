Installation
------------
Do not install the game at the current time, just run it out of the 
source directory.
This will be addressed in future releases


What Works (tm)
---------------
* Terrain Modification (up/down/level)
* Zoning (residential/commercial/industrial)
* Power sub-system (power transmission along lines)
* Routing backbone (for roads, powerlines etc)
* Basic housing (need more models - make them in BLENDER and send them to me!!)
* Basic toolbox
* Basic micro-simulators

What's coming
-------------
* Many more models for buildings
* Better toolbox
* More zones (low/hi density)
* Amusement stuff (marinas, zoos, ski-resort zone)
* Statistics


Controls
--------
A toolbox is in place.  Click on the toolbox buttons to get the submenus.
Some toolbox commands are not in place yet.  Try these keys..

	u = Raise terrain (hold left mouse down and drag)
	d = Lower terrain (same as above)
	l = Level Terrain (same)
	r = Zone residential (drag box)
	c = Zone commercial (drag box)
	i = Zone industrial (drag box)
	x = Dezone (drag box)
	k = Destroy building

	p = Place power line (Click and drag)
	t = Place Road (As above)

	View Controls
	-------------
		[ = Rotate left
		] = Rotate right
		- = zoom in
		= = zoom out
		8 (Num Pad) - Move forward
		2 (Num PaD) - Move back


Features
--------
	. Crashes on demand
	. OpenGL based graphics
	. Fully 3D (rotateable map etc)

Playing
-------
	Houses/Etc will build if they are < 2 tiles from a road and powered.
	The big blue cube in the middle of the map is a power plant.  You
can't build those at the moment (working on it).
	Have fun...


BUGS - Priority top (high) to bottom (low)
------------------------------------------

	. Rendering bug.  If a zone tile is behind a slope in the rendering 
	  direction, rendering will screw up.  This was a casualty of my new
	  rendering design.  Fix coming soon.
	. A Tile is not selected sometimes if it is sloped and the mouse
	  pointer is aimed at the top half of it.  Algo needs work
