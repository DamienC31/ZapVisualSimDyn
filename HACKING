Hacking Free Reign
==================

Following is an outline of the functionality of each source file in this
distribution.

UInterface.cpp 
==============
The user interface for Free Reign. Handles things like mouse pointer
positioning in the world, input from the toolbox, keyboard input


main.cpp
========
Initialises the world.  Doesn't do much else.  You can set the size of the
map in this file at the moment, but this will change in future releases as
it will become a menu option


powersim.cpp
============
The power subsystem simulator.  Basically it has a vector of all power
supplying objects in the system, and sets of the conductivity of each
cell.


user.cpp
========
Contains information about the "God" of the world, stuff like current
funds etc.


button.cpp
==========
Part of the button bar, contains the stuff for a toolbox button, like
texture, the call back function...


maths.cpp
=========
Miscellaneous maths stuff like normal calculation etc..


render.cpp
==========
The main rendering class.  Handles line drawing, structure drawing,
terrain drawing..


vertex2D.cpp
============
A 2D vertex implementation

buttonbar.cpp
=============
The rest of the button bar class, contains references to all the buttons
in the toolbox and their parents.

microsim.cpp
============
The micro simulator base class.  All microsimulators are derived from this
class.


residsim.cpp
============
The residential simulator - handles allocating residential buildings to
squares of that zone, residential economics, population etc..


vertex3D.cpp
============
A standard 3D vertex

cell.cpp
========
A map cell, contains references to structures, parameters etc.  Also
handles transmission of electricity to adjacent cells.

misc.cpp
========
Miscellaneous functions that can't go elsewhere

structure.cpp
=============
The 3D description of a building, it's parameters etc..

vertex3Dp.cpp
=============
A 3D vertex containing pointers to floats, used for the map.

face.cpp 
========
A standard polygon class.


parameter.cpp  
=============
The parameter class, used everywhere to describe stuff.  This needs an
overhaul as it is slow as all hell.


texture.cpp   
===========
A GL texture container.


world.cpp
=========
The world class.  Contains the map, the user, and the user interface
