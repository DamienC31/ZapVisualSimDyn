=============================


This is more of a coding FAQ than anything else....



Q1. Why don't I use GL vertex arrays for the map drawing?

	Whilst very good, the vertex array system would be cumbersome in 
this case.  If you look in render.cpp, you'll see that we draw the
polygons in runs - i.e. if there are no terrain changes for 20 cells in a
straight line, we draw that as one big rectangle (or more correctly, 2 big
triangles).  Where as with vertex arrays we'd still be drawing all the
polygons seperately- and lose speed. For example, on a flat map (best case
for this algorithm) on a 100x100 map, we draw 200 polygons (100 rowsx2
tris).  Using vertex arrays, we'd draw 10000 - see?


Q2. What rules do/will the residential/commercial/industrial simulators
follow?

	The residential simulator will only allow a house to build if it's
near a road that goes somewhere (i.e. to an industrial or commercial
estate).  The square must also be powered, and the road must be no more
than 2 cells away.  Nearby facilities such as parks, etc, increase the
chance of building and land values.
